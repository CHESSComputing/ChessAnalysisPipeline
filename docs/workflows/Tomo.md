# Tomography subpackage (CHAP.tomo)

The tomography subpackage contains the modules that are unique to tomography data processing workflows. This document describes how to run a tomography reconstruction workflow in a Linux terminal.

## Tomographic reconstruction

Tomography is a type of 3D imaging that uses some type of penetrative wave (an X-ray beam at CHESS). Tomographic reconstruction refers to the process of recovering 3D spatial information on an object from a set of projected images acquired under different angles after transmission of the beam through the sample.

| Illustration of tomographic reconstruction (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomographic_reconstruction). The projected image on the detector results from transmission of the beam through the sample at a given angle at varying locations. The intensity at the detector depends on the amount of scattering and absorption in the sample or on, what is often called, its linear attenuation coefficient. Spatial variations in for example density can lead to spatial variations of the local attenuation coefficient. The intensity on the detector is basically a measure of its line integral along a path $AB$ at a projected sample position $r$. We can then obtain full 3D reconstruction of the spatial variation from a set of 2D images at varying angles $\theta$ by a mathematical inversion technique called the inverse Radon transform  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon_transform). |

## The input data

A standard tomographic experiment at CHESS (and other similar institutions) consist of a set of X-ray transmission measurements captured on a 2D area detector. It typically involves two (sets of) measurements without a sample in the beam, one with the beam stop in place (the dark image), and one with the beam stop open (the bright image). Followed by a measurement of a stack of images (a tomographic image series) at varying rotation angle (over 180 or a full 360 degrees of rotation) with the sample in the beam secured to a rotating sample holder. Note that if the sample is larger than the beam cross section, this may require multiple image stacks at various sample positions in the plane perpendicular to the X-ray beam.

## Processing the data

A standard tomographic reconstruction in CHAP consists of three steps:

- Reducing the data, i.e., correcting the raw detector images for background and non-uniformities in the beam intensity profile using dark and bright fields collected separately from the tomography image series.

- Finding the calibrated rotation axis. Accurate reconstruction relies on accurately knowing the center of rotation at each data plane perpendicular to the rotation axis (the sinogram). This rotation axis is calibrated by selecting two data planes, one near the top and one near the bottom of the sample or beam, and visually or automatically picking the optimal center location.

- Reconstructing the reduced data for the calibrated rotation axis. For samples taller than the height of the beam, this last step can consist of two parts:
    - reconstruction of each individual stack of images, and
    - combining the individual stacks into one 3D reconstructed data set.

Note that combining stacks with a horizontal displacement for samples wider than the width of the beam are not yet implemented.

## Activating the tomography conda environment

### From the CHESS Compute Farm

Log in to the CHESS Compute Farm and activate the `CHAP_tomo` environment:
```bash
source /nfs/chess/sw/miniforge3_chap/bin/activate
```
```bash
conda activate CHAP_tomo
```

### From a local CHAP clone

1. Create and activate a base conda environent, e.g. with [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).
1. Install a local version of the CHAP package according to the [instructions](/docs/installation.md)
1. Create the tomography conda environment:
   ```bash
   mamba env create -f <path_to_CHAP_clone_dir>/CHAP/tomo/environment.yml
   ```
1. Activate the `CHAP_tomo` environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate CHAP_tomo
   ```

## Running a tomography reconstruction

1. Navigate to your work directory.
1. Create the required CHAP pipeline file for the workflow (see below) and any additional workflow specific input files. This typically includes at a minimum the detector configuration `.yaml` file with the detector image size information. For example, for the andor2 detector (`andor2.yaml`):
    ```
    prefix: andor2
    rows: 2160
    columns: 2560
    pixel_size:
    - 0.0065
    - 0.0065
    lens_magnification: 5.0
    ``` 
    Here, the prefix field must equal a detector ID field in the `detectors` list in the pipeline input file.
1. Run the reconstruction:
   ```bash
   CHAP <pipelinefilename>
   ```
1. Respond to any prompts that pop up if running interactively.

## Inspecting output

The output consists of a single NeXus (`.nxs`) file containing the reconstructed data set as well as all metadata pertaining to the reconstruction. Additionally, optional output figures (`.png`) may be saved to an output directory specified in the pipeline file.

The optional output figures can be viewed directly by any PNG image viewer. The data in the NeXus output file can be viewed in [NeXpy](https://nexpy.github.io/nexpy/), a high-level python interface to HDF5 files, particularly those stored as [NeXus data](http://www.nexusformat.org):

1. Open the NeXpy GUI by entering in your terminal:
   ```bash
   nexpy &
   ```
1. After the GUI pops up, click File -> Open to navigate to the folder where your output `.nxs` file was saved, and select it.
1. Double click on the base level `NXroot` field in the leftmost "NeXus Data" panel to view the reconstruction. Note that the `NXroot` name is always the basename of the output file.
1. Or navigate the filetree in the "NeXus Data" panel to inspect any other output or metadata field. Note that the latest data set in any tomography reconstruction workflow is always available under the "data" `NXdata` field among the default `NXentry`'s fields (it is this data set that is opened in the viewer panel when double clicking the `NXroot` field). The default `NXentry` name is always the "title" field in the workflow's map configuration.

## Creating the pipeline file

Create a workflow `pipeline.yaml` file according to the [instructions](/docs/pipeline.md). A generic pipeline input file for a full tomography reconstruction workflow is as follows (note that spaces and indentation are important in `.yaml` files):
```
config:
  root: .           # Change as desired
  inputdir: .       # Change as desired
                    # Path can be relative to root (line 2) or absolute
  outputdir: output # Change as desired
                    # Path can be relative to root (line 2) or absolute
  interactive: true # Change as desired
  log_level: INFO

## Example

The CHAP tomography subpackage comes with several workflow examples, one of them for an CHESS ID3A beamline style experiment of a truncated hollow four sided pyramid made from a single homogeneous material.

This example uses simulated raw imaging data that needs to be available in a specific location ahead of the reconstruction. If you are logged in on the CHESS Compute Farm, replace `<path_to_CHAP_clone_dir>` below with `/nfs/chess/sw/ChessAnalysisPipeline`, the path to the CHAP repository administrated by the CHAP developers. If not, replace it with the path to your local CHAP repository. In the later case, you will also need to create the raw data once, since it is not part of the cloned repository. To do so, create and activate your local CHAP_tomo conda environment as instructed above, navigate to your local CHAP repository, and execute:
```bash
CHAP examples/tomo/pipeline_id3a_pyramid_sim.yaml
```

To perform the reconstruction:

1. Create a work directory in your own user space.
1. Within the work directory, create a plain text file, named `pipeline_id3a_pyramid.yaml`, with the following content (note that spaces and indentation are important in `.yaml` files):
    ```
    config:
      root: .
      inputdir: <path_to_CHAP_clone_dir>/examples/tomo/config
      outputdir: hollow_pyramid
      interactive: true
      log_level: INFO

    pipeline:

      # Create the map
      - common.MapProcessor:
          config:
            title: hollow_pyramid
            station: id3a
            experiment_type: TOMO
            sample:
              name: hollow_pyramid
            spec_scans:
              - spec_file: ../data/hollow_pyramid/spec.log
                scan_numbers: [3, 4, 5]
            independent_dimensions:
              - label: rotation_angles

              - label: x_translation
                units: mm
                data_type: smb_par
                name: ramsx
              - label: z_translation
                units: mm
                data_type: smb_par
                name: ramsz
          detectors:
            - id: sim
          schema: tomofields
      - pipeline.MultiplePipelineItem:
          items:
            - common.SpecReader:
                config:
                  station: id3a
                  experiment_type: TOMO
                  spec_scans:
                    - spec_file: ../data/hollow_pyramid/spec.log
                      scan_numbers: 1
                detectors:
                  - id: sim
                schema: darkfield
            - common.SpecReader:
                inputdir: ../data/hollow_pyramid
                config:
                  station: id3a

                detectors:
                  - id: sim
                schema: brightfield
            - common.YAMLReader:
                filename: detector_pyramid.yaml
                schema: tomo.models.Detector
      - tomo.TomoCHESSMapConverter

      # Full tomography reconstruction
      - tomo.TomoDataProcessor:
          reduce_data: true
          find_center: true
          reconstruct_data: true
          combine_data: true
          outputdir: saved_figs
          save_figs: 'only'
      - common.NexusWriter:
          filename: combined_hollow_pyramid.nxs
          force_overwrite: true
    ```
1. Execute
    ```bash
    CHAP pipeline_id3a_pyramid.yaml
    ```
1. Follow the interactive prompts or replace `true` with `false` on line 5 in `pipeline_id3a_pyramid.yaml` (`interactive: false`) and run the workflow non-interactively.
1. Inspect the results:
    - In NeXpy, as instructed above, navigate to `<your_work_directory>/hollow_pyramid` and open `combined_hollow_pyramid.nxs`
    - By displaying the output figures in `<your_work_directory>/hollow_pyramid/save_figs`

The "config" block defines the CHAP generic configuration parameters:

- `root`: The work directory, defaults to the current directory (where `CHAP <pipelinefilename>` is executed). Must be an absolute path or relative to the current directory.

- `inputdir`: The default directory for files read by any CHAP reader (must have read access), defaults to `root`. Must be an absolute path or relative to `root`.

- `outputdir`: The default directory for files written by any CHAP writter (must have write access, will be created if not existing), defaults to `root`. Must be an absolute path or relative to `root`.

- `interactive`: Allows for user interactions, defaults to `false`.

- `log_level`: The [Python logging level](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#levels).

The "pipeline" block creates the actual workflow pipeline, it this example it consists of four toplevel processes that get executed successively:

- `common.MapProcessor`: A processor that creates a CHESS style map.

- `pipeline.MultiplePipelineItem`: A processor that executes (in this case reads) three items and passes the inputs on to the next item in the pipeline.

- `tomo.TomoCHESSMapConverter`: A processor that converts the inputs to a CHESS style map.

- `tomo.TomoDataProcessor`: The actual tomographic reconstruction processor that creates a single NeXus object with the reconstructed data as well as all metadata pertaining to the reconstruction and passes it on to the next item in the pipeline.

- `common.NexusWriter`: A processor that writes the reconstructed data to a NeXus file.

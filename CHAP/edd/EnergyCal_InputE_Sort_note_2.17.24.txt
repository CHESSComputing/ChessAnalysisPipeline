# Preserving the alternative position of sorting input peak energies for Energy calibration until inside "calibrate"
# Motivation: in future, the FIRST input peak energy could be used to anchor the initial energy calibration, 
# by insisting that it is the highest peak in the energy range. For instance if (by inspection) we identify 
# the Ceria Ka1 fluorescence peak as the brighgest in a region (of channels, e.g.) then by putting that energy first
# "find_peaks" could identify that peak with the given peak energy and compute a first calibration.
# This would be a better alternative than specifying max energy.

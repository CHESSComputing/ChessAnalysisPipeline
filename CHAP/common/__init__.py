"""This subpackage of `CHAP` contains `PipelineItem`s that are or can
be used in workflows for processing data from multiple different X-ray
techniques.

In addition, `CHAP.common` contains two subpackages of its own:
[`CHAP.common.models`](CHAP.common.models.md) contains tools for
validating input data in some `Processor`s.
[`CHAP.common.utils`](CHAP.common.utils.md) contains a
broad selection of utilities to assist in some common tasks that
appear in specific `Processor` implementations.
